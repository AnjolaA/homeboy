The opportunity to play a vital role in modernising and digitising the bank's footprint is appealing. I am eager to contribute my expertise in service management and cloud technologies to achieve outstanding outcomes. Since I have joined the Group, I have had the privilege of leading a proficient team in the successful delivery of numerous DevOps projects within the esteemed Nimbus and Domus teams. In this capacity, I have actively contributed to shaping critical infrastructure decisions, always approaching these matters from a DevOps and Platform perspective.

Throughout my career, I have had opportunities to lead and collaborate with internal teams and 3rd-party providers in service management environments and other capacities. I have been an advocate for excellent products and services, leveraging my high-level understanding of cloud technologies to drive innovation and improvements. My strong influencing skills have allowed me to build productive relationships with internal and external stakeholders, ensuring seamless product and service delivery.

While working as a quality engineer, risk management has been at the core of my approach, from application development, pipeline for delivery to operation and maintenance. Within Nimbus, I have led and participated in the patching and maintenance of services, adhering to industry standards and best practices, such as ITIL-based services like Incident, Problem, and Change management to release versioned libraries for use across various teams.

While working with the NHS, I have worked closely with SRE teams and helped to define and achieve service level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs) to ensure optimal cloud platform operations. One of my strengths lies in providing an active voice to consumers and identifying and resolving impediments and issues. 

I love data and dashboards and I strive to ensure service status, metrics, and performance are communicated effectively to all stakeholders. Owning service dashboards and reporting will be a top priority for me, as it enables data-driven decision-making and accountability. My operational and leadership skills will help me ensure supplier and internal team obligations are met, and service levels are consistently achieved.

Since I have joined the Group, I have enjoyed the prospect of working in a diverse and inclusive environment, alongside great colleagues, and I am confident that my skills, experience, and enthusiasm make me a strong fit for this role.

I believe that if given the opportunity to leading a team of SREs, Operations Engineers, and 3rd-party providers, I will foster an environment of continuous improvement, automation, and efficiency.
